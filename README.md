Basic PokeDex-type app to display all information about the many different Pokemon. (Catalog to show information about various Pokemon, their types, physical info, evolution tree, genders, etc.)
View by Region/Generation or even search for any Pokemon to find out more about each one.

Made using Flutter over the course of about 3 days to practice basic layout building, screen switching as well as loading and searching through data to display on the screen. Complete as a newer version is being made with more features but wanted to leave this one up as is so I can see my own progress with Flutter development.

All information was collected from the Official Pokemon website using a web scraper created by me to dump into a dart file that is read to display the information, manually typing in the info for all 1010 different Pokemon would have simply taken too long.  

The App is not perfect or optimized but is more just for me to practice my flutter and dart skills. 

This is just a "v1", The app has been remade from the ground up using some more advanced techniques.
